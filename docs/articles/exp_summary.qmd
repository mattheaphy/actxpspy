title: "Experience summaries"
---

After experience data has been prepared for analysis, the next step is to summarize results. The actxps package's workhorse function for summarizing termination experience is `exp_stats()`. This function returns an `exp_df` object, which is a type of data frame containing additional attributes about the experience study.
