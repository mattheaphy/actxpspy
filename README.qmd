The actxps package provides a set of tools to assist with the creation
of actuarial experience studies. Experience studies are used by
actuaries to explore historical experience across blocks of business and
to inform assumption setting for projection models.

- The `ExposedDF()` class converts census-level records into policy 
or calendar year exposure records.

## Basic usage

The actxps package includes simulated census data for a theoretical 
deferred annuity product with an optional guaranteed income rider. 
The grain of this data is one row *per policy*.

```{python}
#| label: packages
import actxps as xp

census_dat = xp.load_census_dat()
print(census_dat)
```

Convert census records to exposure records with one row *per policy per year*.

```{python}
#| label: example
exposed_data = xp.ExposedDF(census_dat,
                            end_date="2019-12-31",
                            target_status="Surrender")

exposed_data
```
